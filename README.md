# üåø Crop-Disease-Prediction

This repository contains code to detect whether a plant is diseased or not using a single leaf image. The project utilizes machine learning to analyze leaf images and classify them as healthy or diseased.

The code is inspired from codebasics Youtube channel

The dataset used is PlantVillage dataset from kaggle (For demonstration purpose only the pepper bell and potato part is used)

## ‚ö°Future Work

### ‚úàÔ∏è Integration with Drone Technology

In the future, this project aims to expand beyond single leaf images to comprehensive field analysis using drone technology. Which include:

1. **Capture Drone Images**:
   - Use drones to capture high-resolution images of the entire field.

2. **Create Composite Image**:
   - Stitch drone images together to create a complete field composite.

3. **Divide into Sections**:
   - Segment the composite image into manageable sections.

4. **Apply Machine Learning**:
   - Apply machine learning algorithms to analyze each section for:
     - Plant Diseases
     - Nutrient Deficiencies
     - Pests

5. **Highlight Areas Needing Attention**:
   - Identify and highlight sections needing immediate attention based on analysis results.

6. **Provide Actionable Insights**:
   - Present actionable insights through a user-friendly interface:
     - Highlight problem areas.
     - Recommend targeted interventions.

By leveraging drone technology, this project aims to provide farmers with a holistic view of their fields, enabling precision agriculture practices that can significantly improve crop health and yield.
